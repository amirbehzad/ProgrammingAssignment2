### Solution for the 2nd Programming Assignment

This is my solution to 2nd programming assignment, from the "R Programming"
course, provided by coursera.  The question is to write a function in R
cache the inverse of a given matrix.

Please explore the contents of cachematrix.R

You can also run the test:

    $ git clone https://github.com/amirbehzad/ProgrammingAssignment2.git
    $ R --no-save < test.cachematrix.R
