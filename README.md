### Solution to 2nd Programming Assignment

This is my solution to 2nd programming assignment, from the "R Programming"
course, provided by coursera.  The question is to write a function in R
cache the inverse of a given matrix.

To run the test, try this:
    $ git clone https://github.com/amirbehzad/ProgrammingAssignment2.git
    $ R --no-save < test.cachematrix.R
